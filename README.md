These are the steps:

1. Create account

3. Add address
4. Confirm details

A user can also sign in to see their account

## Write cucumber tests

* Setup cucumber and write some scenarios to test the registration and sign in.  
* There may be some bugs present in the code, so you may create scenarios that are red, but should be green after bug fixing.
